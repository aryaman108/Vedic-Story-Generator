==================================================

In the blessed village of Vrindavan, where divine love flows like honey and every corner echoes with celestial melodies, lived young Krishna with his foster parents Yasoda and Nanda. Though appearing as an ordinary child, Krishna carried within him the essence of the supreme divine.

Every morning, mother Yasoda would churn fresh butter in large earthen pots, filling the house with the sweet aroma of fresh dairy. The golden butter, rich and creamy, was not just food but an offering of pure love and devotion.

Little Krishna, with his twinkling eyes and mischievous smile, was irresistibly drawn to these pots of butter. When Yasoda was busy with household chores, Krishna would gather his cowherd friends - Balarama, Sudama, and others. Together, they would form human pyramids, standing on each other's shoulders to reach the high-hanging butter pots.

One particular morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of gold and pink, Krishna executed his most daring butter heist yet. He climbed onto Balarama's shoulders, reached for the largest pot, and began distributing the creamy treasure among his friends and even the monkeys who had gathered to watch.

When Yasoda discovered butter handprints on the walls and empty pots, she knew immediately who the culprit was. She found Krishna sitting innocently, his face and clothes covered in butter, trying to look as if nothing had happened.

"Krishna!" Yasoda called out with mock anger, though her heart was filled with overwhelming love. "Why do you steal butter when I would gladly give you all you want?"

Krishna looked up with his innocent, large eyes and replied, "Mother, when you give me butter, it tastes sweet. But when I take it myself with my friends, sharing our joy and laughter, it tastes like divine nectar. The love we share in that moment makes everything more delicious."

Yasoda understood then that Krishna's actions were not mere childish pranks, but divine play - what the sages call 'Leela.' Through his playful stealing, Krishna was teaching that divine love cannot be contained by rules or boundaries. True devotion flows freely, spontaneously, and joyfully.

The butter stealing also symbolized how the divine lovingly 'steals' the hearts of devotees, not through force, but through irresistible charm and love. Just as Krishna took butter with innocent joy, the divine takes our hearts filled with ego and transforms them into vessels of pure love.

From that day forward, Yasoda would leave butter pots at various heights, not to prevent Krishna from taking them, but to enjoy watching his divine play. She realized that in trying to catch Krishna, she was actually being caught by divine love herself.
