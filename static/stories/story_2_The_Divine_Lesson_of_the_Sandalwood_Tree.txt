==================================================

In ancient times, there grew a magnificent sandalwood tree in the Malaya mountains. This tree was special not just for its fragrant wood, but for the wisdom it would impart to seekers who came to rest in its shade.

One day, a young seeker named Vidya arrived at the tree, troubled by the ways of the world. She had seen good people suffer while the wicked prospered, and her faith was shaken.

The sandalwood tree, recognizing her pure heart, spoke to her in a gentle voice: "Child, why do you look so disturbed?"

Vidya explained her confusion about the apparent injustices in the world. The tree listened patiently, then shared its wisdom:

"Look around me, dear one. See how different creatures interact with me. The snakes wrap around my trunk, trying to poison me with their venom, yet I transform their poison into sweet fragrance. The bees come and take my essence to make honey. The woodcutters come to cut my branches, yet I give them my precious wood freely."

"But how do you remain peaceful through all this?" asked Vidya.

The tree replied, "Because I understand dharma - the eternal law. My nature is to give fragrance and healing, regardless of how others treat me. The snake cannot change my essence, only I can do that by forgetting my true nature."

"This is the secret, child. Each being has a divine essence that cannot be destroyed by external circumstances. When you act according to your highest nature - with love, compassion, and wisdom - you remain untouched by the apparent injustices around you."

Vidya realized that the tree was teaching her about detachment and duty without expectation of results, the core teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.

From that day forward, she dedicated herself to serving others with the same selfless spirit as the sandalwood tree, finding peace and purpose in righteous action regardless of outcomes.
